# blackAndWhite Photos Slider

As I used to hold my camera around. I picked some photos that I wanted -as part of my training as well- to showcase this works through a small JS project, that was a dynamic slider that you can use to move up and down my little exhibition while you still also can run it as a movie if you hit the play/stop button to watch it sliding over smoothly.

Here's if you'd like to go and have a look:

*The slider could be slower than expected even they're only few photos due to the free-hosting hassles , I appreciate your patiance.
